World Engine QGIS Plugin
=====================
This pluging is designed to be used as an interface between the QGIS graphical interface and the analytical capabilities of World Engine.

In order to use this, clone this repo and place it in the directory set aside for QGIS plug-ins. It should load automatically on startup. This plugin has been tested with QGIS version 2.8.2 and the latest version of World Engine.
